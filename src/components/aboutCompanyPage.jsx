                    men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the 
                    moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and 
                    trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who 
                    fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying 
                    through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and 
                    easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is 
                    untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like 
                    best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in 
                    certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of 
                    business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and 
                    annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters 
                    to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other 
                    greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
